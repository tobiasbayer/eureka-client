# eureka-client

This library aims to be a Clojure client for Netflix' Eureka service registry.
At the moment registering an app and sending heartbeats is supported.
Instances of an app can be retrieved.

Latest release version:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/eureka-client/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/eureka-client)

## Usage

Include eureka-client as a dependency in your ```project.clj```:
```
[eureka-client "0.2.0"]
```

To build from source, run the following commands:
```
lein deps
lein install
```

Register your service "my-service-name" with port 10100 at the Eureka server at localhost:8761 like this:
```
(ns your.name.space
  (:require [eureka-client.core :as eureka]))

  (eureka/register "localhost" 8761 "my-service-name" 10100)
```

After registering, a heartbeat will automatically be sent every 20 seconds.
The instance ID of the registered service is returned.

Request all instances for "my-service-name" (after two instances have been registered):
```
(eureka/find-instances "localhost" 8761 "my-service-name")

; => '({:ip "192.168.178.38" :port 10100} {:ip "192.168.178.38" :port 11100})
```

Delete instance "instance-id" of service "my-service-name" from the eureka server:
```
(eureka/delete-instance "localhost" 8761 "my-service-name" "instance-id")

; => true
```
Returns success state.

Change the server url of the eureka server. Standard is /eureka/v2/apps
```
(eureka/alter-server-path "/eureka-server/apps")

; => "/eureka-server/apps"
```
